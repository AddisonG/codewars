Theoretically, you just need to find the point between sorted alphabetically, or reverse alphabetically, which is from 1 to factorial(length).

== SCRATCH PAD INSPIRATION ==

NOTE: 8! = 40320

UTSQONIE = 40320 // Lexicographically sorted
UTSQONEI = 40319 // -1! = swap index -1 and -2
...
QUESTION = 24572
...
EINOSQTU = 7 // +3! = swap index -3 and -4
EINOQUTS = 6
EINOQUST = 5
EINOQTUS = 4
EINOQTSU = 3 // +2! = swap index -2 and -3
EINOQSUT = 2 // +1! = swap index -1 and -2
EINOQSTU = 1 // Reverse lexico sorted


== SWAP THEORY - THEORY FOR WORDS WITHOUT DUPLICATES (DISPROVED) ==
Swapping letters is equal to:
	SUM{factorial(length - position) * swapDistance}

EINOQSTU = 1
QINOESTU = 4*7! (20160)
QUNOESTI = 6*6! (4320)
QUEONSTI = 2*5! (240)
QUESNOTI = 2*4! (48)
QUESTONI = 2*3! (12)
QUESTINO = 2*2! (4)
QUESTION = 2*1! (2)
TOTAL = 24786 (WRONG - should be 24572, off by 214)


== MOVE THEORY - THEORY FOR WORDS WITHOUT DUPLICATES (PROVEN) ==
Moving letters is equal to:
	SUM{factorial(length - position) * moveDistance}

EINOQSTU = 1
QEINOSTU = 4*7! (20160)
QUEINOST = 6*6! (4320)
QUEINOST = 0*5! (0)
QUESINOT = 3*4! (72)
QUESTINO = 3*3! (18)
QUESTION = 1*2! (2)
QUESTION = 0*1! (0)
TOTAL = 24572 (CORRECT)

// = 4*7!(20160) + 6*6!(4320) + 0*5!(0) + 3*4!(72) + 3*3!(18) + 0*2!(0) + 0 + 2

== MOVE THEORY ENHANCED - THEORY FOR WORDS WITH DUPLICATE LETTERS (DISPROVEN) ==
When moving a letter using MOVE THEORY (MT), it appears that the result is about twice what it should be if there is a duplicate at the end.
For solving words that contain a duplicated letter, it SEEMS that if the letter is being moved BEFORE the pair, it should be halved.

This was proven using a basic example, "ZACXBX":

MT result = 609 = (600 + 6 + 2 + 1)
True result = 305 = (600 / 2 + 6 / 2 + 2 / 2)

This seems to hold true for other, slightly more complicated examples, that still only have a double.

I'm going to assume that if there are 2 doubles, then I just multiply them together, and divide?

(TENTATIVELY CONFIRMED?)

I'm going to assume that this works for triples?

(FALSE) - Number too large. Need a larger divisor.

I'm going to assume that I need to use factorials on these too?
Meaning that if I have a triple, I need to divide by 3! (=6)

(CONFIRMED and SOLVED)
